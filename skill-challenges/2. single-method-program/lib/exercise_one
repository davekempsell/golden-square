1 Describe the problem:
# As a user, so that I can manage my time, I want to see an estimate
# of reading time for a text, assuming I can read 200 words a minute

2. Design the method signature
Include the name of the method, its parameters, return value, and side effects.

reading_time = estimate_reading_time("text")

* reading_time is an integer representing minutes

3. Create examples as tests
Make a list of examples of what the method will take and return.

estimate_reading_time(EIGHT_WORDS) => 1
estimate_reading_time(THREE_HUNDRED_WORDS) => 2
estimate_reading_time(TEN_THOUSAND_WORDS) => 50
estimate_reading_time(nil) throws an error

4. implement the behaviour
